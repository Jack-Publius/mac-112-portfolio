## Exercise 2: Import tidy data

**Import the data**

survey \<- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/112_fall_2024_survey.csv")

## Exercise 3: Tidy data properties

-   What are the units of observation, ie, what does each row represent?

Individuals and their preferences

-   Name one quantitative variable, ie, column, in the dataset.

Individual preferred environmental temperature

-   Name one categorical variable, ie, column, in the dataset.

Individual favourite food

## Exercise 4: Get to know the data

**Count the number of rows and columns**

dim(survey)

**Count the number of rows**

nrow(survey)

**Provide the first n rows of the survey**

head(survey)

**Provide the first 3 rows of the survey**

head(survey, 3)

**Return the last part of the survey**

tail(survey)

**Provide titles of the survey**

names(survey)

## Exercise 5: Data structure

Obtain the overall class of the survey object

class(survey)

Examine the structure of each variable within survey (including class)

Just take note of what information we gain here (no need to write more)

str(survey)

## Exercise 6: Your turn

**Import and name the dataset (you pick a name!)**

soccer \<- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv")

**Print the first 6 rows of the dataset**

head(soccer)

**How many years of data do we have? And how many measurements do we have on each year?**

dim(soccer)

Years of data=21 Measurements=10

**Get a list of all variable names in the dataset**

names(soccer)="year" "host" "winner" "second" "third" "fourth" "goals_scored" "teams" "games" "attendance"

**Display the class and other information for each variable in the dataset**

str(soccer)

## Exercise 7: Brainstorm

-   Which country is the winner in the World Cup of 2006?
-   Which country is the host of the World Cup of 1970?
-   When did the amount of team change to 32?
